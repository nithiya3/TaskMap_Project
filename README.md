Interactive GIS Map Application
Overview:
The Interactive GIS Map Application is a web-based project designed to visualize geographic data. It uses the Django framework for backend operations and Leaflet.js to render an interactive map on the frontend. Users can visualize data points on the map, with markers dynamically created from JSON data passed from Django.

The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. Animations are included to enhance the user experience, such as smooth map loading and page transitions.

Features:
Interactive Map: Users can interact with the map, zooming and panning to explore geographic data.
Dynamic Markers: Markers on the map are generated from the backend as JSON data and are clickable, showing information in popups.
Smooth Animations: Animated elements, including page load and marker display, ensure a smooth user experience.
Responsive Layout: The design adapts automatically to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
Footer with Additional Info: A fixed footer contains basic information about the map and includes a reload button for the map.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Django (Python Web Framework)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js (for the map)
Map Tiles: OpenStreetMap
JSON Data: Passed from Django backend to the frontend
Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following

software installed:
Python 3.x: If you don’t have Python, you can download it from python.org.
Django: The Python framework used for backend operations.
Install Django with:
    pip install django
Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended for project isolation):
Install virtualenv if it’s not already installed:
    pip install virtualenv
Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-map-app.git
    cd interactive-map-app
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP and extract it to your preferred directory.

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to avoid dependency conflicts:
Create the virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate

Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
Install all required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Apply Database Migrations
Run migrations to set up the database schema:
    python manage.py migrate

Step 5: Run the Development Server
To run the application locally, start the Django development server:
    python manage.py runserver

Now, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to access the interactive map.

Usage:
Once the Django server is running, you can access the app via the following:

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.
The map should load with markers plotted based on the backend data.
Click on a marker to view additional details in a popup.
To modify the data, update the data in the views.py file (located inside the gis_map directory) and adjust the template as necessary.

Deployment:
You can deploy the application to various platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
